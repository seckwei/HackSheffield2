##Inspiration

We took inspiration from ourselves in the sense that we are very lazy.

##What it does

Allows you to lazily create websites with your voice.

##How we built it

Uses Amazon Alexa, Amazon Web Services, Lamda and nodeJS

##Challenges we ran into

Getting used to how Alexa works as well as Amazon Web Services as these were technologies that were new to us.

##Accomplishments that we're proud of

Having an MVP by the finish time Having extra time to add in advanced features such as Bootstrap snippets to add in Jumbotrons and Navbars

##What's next for Lazy Web Dev

More lazy features More intents allowing easier web development
